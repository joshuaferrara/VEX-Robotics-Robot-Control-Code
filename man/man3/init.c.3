.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void initialize ()"
Runs user initialization code\&. This function will be started in its own task with the default priority and stack size once when the robot is starting up\&. It is possible that the VEXnet communication link may not be fully established at this time, so reading from the VEX Joystick may fail\&.
.PP
This function should initialize most sensors (gyro, encoders, ultrasonics), LCDs, global variables, and IMEs\&.
.PP
This function must exit relatively promptly, or the \fBoperatorControl()\fP and \fBautonomous()\fP tasks will not start\&. An autonomous mode selection menu like the pre_auton() in other environments can be implemented in this task if desired\&. 
.SS "void initializeIO ()"
Runs pre-initialization code\&. This function will be started in kernel mode one time while the VEX Cortex is starting up\&. As the scheduler is still paused, most API functions will fail\&.
.PP
The purpose of this function is solely to set the default pin modes (\fBpinMode()\fP) and port states (\fBdigitalWrite()\fP) of limit switches, push buttons, and solenoids\&. It can also safely configure a UART port (usartOpen()) but cannot set up an LCD (\fBlcdInit()\fP)\&.
